# **🍔 QuickBite Express – Crisis & Impact Analysis**

# Project Overview 

QuickBite Express is a Bengaluru-based food-tech startup that faced a major brand crisis in June 2025 due to a viral social media incident involving food safety issues and a week-long delivery outage.

This project analyzes how the crisis affected customer behavior, restaurant performance, delivery operations, and revenue, and proposes a data-driven recovery strategy.

The analysis combines Power BI dashboards, SQL insights, and research-backed secondary analysis to identify the root causes of decline and suggest measurable recovery actions.
